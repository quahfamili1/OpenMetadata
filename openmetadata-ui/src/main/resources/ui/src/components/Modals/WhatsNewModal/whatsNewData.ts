**RBAC for Domains:**

With the 1.5.0 release, we are adding more stricter controls around Domain. Now teams/data assets/glossaries and classification can have domain concepts and can get a policy such that only users within a domain can access the data within a domain. Domain owners can use data products as a way to publish data products and showcase publicly available data assets from a specific domain.

This will help large companies to use a single OpenMetadata platform to unify all of their data and teams but also provide more stringent controls to segment the data between domains.`,

We are also making the discovery of data more accessible for users introducing a data asset widget, which will group the assets by platform type.

      ['Backward Incompatible Changes']: `**Multi Owners:**

- OpenMetadata allows a single user or a team to be tagged as owners for any data assets. In Release 1.5.0, we allow users to tag multiple individual owners or a single team. This will allow organizations to add ownership to multiple individuals without necessarily needing to create a team around them like previously.
- This is a backward incompatible change, if you are using APIs, please make sure the owner field is now changed to "owners"

**Import/Export Format:**

- To support the multi-owner format, we have now changed how we export and import the CSV file in glossary, services, database, schema, table, etc. The new format will be

    user:userName;team:TeamName

    **If you are importing an older file, please make sure to make this change.**

**Pydantic V2:**

- The core of OpenMetadata are the JSON Schemas that define the metadata standard. These schemas are automatically translated into Java, Typescript, and Python code with Pydantic classes.
- In this release, we have [migrated](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/migration/) the codebase from Pydantic V1 to Pydantic V2.

**Deployment Related Changes (OSS only):**

- **\`./bootstrap/bootstrap_storage.sh\` removed**
- OpenMetadata community has built rolling upgrades to database schema and the data to make upgrades easier. This tool is now called as \`./bootstrap/openmetadata-ops.sh\` and has been part of our releases since 1.3. The bootstrap_storage.sh doesn't support new native schemas in OpenMetadata. Hence, we have deleted this tool from this release.
- While upgrading, please refer to our Upgrade Notes in the documentation. Always follow the best practices provided there.

**Database Connection Pooling:**

- OpenMetadata uses Jdbi to handle database-related operations such as read/write/delete. In this release, we introduced additional configs to help with connection pooling, allowing the efficient use of a database with low resources.

- Please update the defaults if your cluster is running at a large scale to scale up the connections efficiently.

- For the new configuration, please refer to the [doc](https://docs.open-metadata.org/latest/deployment/database-connection-pooling) here

**Data Insights:**

- The Data Insights application is meant to give you a quick glance at your data's state and allow you to take action based on the information you receive. To continue pursuing this objective, the application was completely refactored to allow customizability.
- Part of this refactor was making Data Insights an internal application, no longer relying on an external pipeline. This means triggering Data Insights from the Python SDK will no longer be possible.
- With this change you will need to **run a backfill on the Data Insights** for the last couple of days since the Data Assets data changed.

**New Explore Page:**

- Explore page displays hierarchically organized data assets by grouping them into services > database > schema > tables/stored procedures. This helps users organically find the data asset they are looking for based on a known database or schema they were using. This is a new feature and changes the way the Explore page was built in previous releases.

**Connector Schema Changes:**

In the latest release, several updates and enhancements have been made to the JSON schema across various connectors. These changes aim to improve security, configurability, and expand integration capabilities. Here's a detailed breakdown of the updates.

-   **KafkaConnect:** Added \`schemaRegistryTopicSuffixName\` to enhance topic configuration flexibility for schema registries.
-   **GCS Datalake:** Introduced \`bucketNames\` field, allowing users to specify targeted storage buckets within the Google Cloud Storage environment.
-   **OpenLineage:** Added \`saslConfig\` to enhance security by enabling SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer) configuration.
-   **Salesforce:** Added \`sslConfig\` to strengthen the security layer for Salesforce connections by supporting SSL.
-   **DeltaLake:** Updated schema by moving \`metastoreConnection\` to a newly created \`metastoreConfig.json\` file. Additionally, introduced \`configSource\` to better define source configurations, with new support for \`metastoreConfig.json\` and \`storageConfig.json\`.
-   **Iceberg:** RestCatalog: Removed \`clientId\` and \`clientSecret\` as mandatory fields, making the schema more flexible for different authentication methods.
-   **DBT:** Cloud Pipelines: Added as a new connector to support cloud-native data transformation workflows using DBT.
-   **Looker:** Expanded support to include connections using GitLab integration, offering more flexible and secure version control.
-   **Tableau:** Enhanced support by adding capabilities for connecting with \`TableauPublishedDatasource\` and \`TableauEmbeddedDatasource\`, providing more granular control over data visualization and reporting.

**Include DDL:**

- During the Database Metadata ingestion, we can optionally pick up the DDL for both tables and views. During the metadata ingestion, we use the view DDLs to generate the View Lineage.
- To reduce the processing time for out-of-the-box workflows, we are disabling the include DDL by default, whereas before, it was enabled, which potentially led to long-running workflows.

**Secrets Manager**
Starting with the release 1.5.0, the JWT Token for the bots will be sent to the Secrets Manager if you configured one. It won't appear anymore in your dag_generated_configs in Airflow.

**Python SDK**
The \`metadata insight\` command has been removed. Since Data Insights application was moved to be an internal system application instead of relying on external pipelines the SDK command to run the pipeline was removed.`,

**Ingestion Workflow Status:**

We are updating how we compute the success percentage. Previously, we took into account for partial success the results of the Source (e.g., the tables we were able to properly retrieve from Snowflake, Redshift, etc.). This means that we had an error threshold in there were if up to 90% of the tables were successfully ingested, we would still consider the workflow as successful. However, any errors when sending the information to OpenMetadata would be considered as a failure.
Now, we're changing this behavior to consider the success rate of all the steps involved in the workflow. The UI will then show more Partial Success statuses rather than Failed, properly reflecting the real state of the workflow.

**Profiler & Auto Classification Workflow:**

We are creating a new Auto Classification workflow that will take care of managing the sample data and PII classification, which was previously done by the Profiler workflow. This change will allow us to have a more modular and scalable system.
The Profiler workflow will now only focus on the profiling part of the data, while the Auto Classification will take care of the rest.

This means that we are removing these properties from the DatabaseServiceProfilerPipeline schema:

-   generateSampleData
-   processPiiSensitive
-   confidence which will be moved to the new
-   Adding Glossary Term view is improved. Now we show glossary terms hierarchically enabling a better understanding of how the terms are setup while adding it to a table or dashboard.
-   DatabaseServiceAutoClassificationPipeline schema.

What you will need to do:

-   If you are using the EXTERNAL ingestion for the profiler (YAML configuration), you will need to update your configuration, removing these properties as well.
-   If you still want to use the Auto PII Classification and sampling features, you can create the new workflow from the UI.

Python 3.8 was [officially EOL on 2024-10-07](https://devguide.python.org/versions/). Some of our dependencies have already started removing support for higher versions, and we are following suit to ensure we are using the latest and most stable versions of our dependencies.

This means that for Release 1.7, the supported Python versions for the Ingestion Framework are 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11.\
We were already shipping our Docker images with Python 3.10, so this change should not affect you if you are using our Docker images. However, if you installed the openmetadata-ingestion package directly, please make sure to update your Python version to 3.9 or higher.`,
      ['Expanded Connector Ecosystem and Diversity']: `OpenMetadata's ingestion framework contains 90+ native connectors. These connectors are the foundation of the platform and bring in all the metadata your team needs: technical metadata, lineage, usage, profiling, etc.

We bring new connectors in each release, continuously expanding our coverage. This time, Release 1.7 comes with four new connectors:
• **Opensearch**: Bringing your index metadata into OpenMetadata.
• **Cassandra**: Ingesting from the NoSQL Distributed Database.
• **Cockroach DB**: The cloud native distributed SQL Database.

And in Collate, we are bringing a new Pipeline connector: **Wherescape**.`,
